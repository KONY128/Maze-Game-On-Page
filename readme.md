# Maze Game On Page!
## How To Fun?
please run **./maze.html** directly 4 fun. Enjoy! ðŸ˜€
## Never Handwrite Web App Again
All HTML\CSS\JavaScript files are man-made. To me, it's a total painðŸ˜­. Maybe I shall use Dreamweaver later.
## Highlight Design
- **Totally interactive!** All elements are interactive. Find some easter eggs please.
- Maze Game is fully animated and you can **skip animation**.
- A **'Top Navigation Button'** only showed after u scrolling the page down away form top.
-  **Four algorithms for maze solving.**
- Four themes for choose. 
- You can **change the theme at any time, even if the maze is working!**
- Customized maze size and **invalid inputs considered.**
- Restart at any point.
- A Nav Bar in top left of the page.
